# Last version 15-12-25

# Model without intervention (vaccination)

# Features:
# - No separation between mild and severe IB infections. I averaged these groups (for example, 1.3x mortality in clinical infections)
# - Bacterial infections in a separate bacterial_state. With a time between IB infection and secondary infection.
# - No separation between subclinical and clinical bacterial infections.
# - respiratory signs as separate state machine
# - growth as separate state machine --> further analysed in R (adding daily gain of each day)

# Not implemented yet:
# - Antibiotic treatments: I put in a first idea, but trigger for treatment is not yet decided
# - stop_condition: Early slaughter when flock is too ill but antibiotics cannot be administered (waiting time) -> ?

# Not going to be implemented?
# - Late slaughter when desired final weight is not reached yet --> difficult because weight is calculated afterwards. Maybe run extra days in all models?

# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each change can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
