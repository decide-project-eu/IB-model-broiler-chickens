## Description

The model simulates an outbreak of IB within a broiler flock. It is based on a typical infection in Dutch conventional broiler flocks. Secondary bacterial infections are also taken into account.
Different scenarios will be compared, including no vaccination and vaccination against the field strain. Currently, only the default model without any vaccination is presented.
